# Migration Complete: From Monolithic to Modular Architecture

## Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the migration of the OS-style application from a monolithic JavaScript codebase (30,368 lines in `app.js`) to a modern, scalable, modular TypeScript architecture compatible with Laravel, InertiaJS, Vue 3, Jetstream with Teams, and Tenancy for Laravel (stancl/tenancy v4).

We need to replace Jetstream with [Laravel Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit/)
