❌ ISSUES FOUND: Jetstream and Teams Still Present
1. User Model Issues (app/Models/User.php):
Missing Import Statements: The model uses HasProfilePhoto and HasTeams traits but the import statements are missing:
Missing Trait Usage: The traits are referenced in the class but not actually used:
Teams Method: Line 228 has return $this->teams()->where('teams.id', $teamId)->exists(); but the teams() method doesn't exist without the HasTeams trait

2. Missing Team Model:
No Team Model: There is no app/Models/Team.php file
Teams Table Migration: database/migrations/2024_01_05_000000_add_desktop_fields_to_teams_table.php exists and references a teams table, but there's no migration that creates the base teams table
Team References: Multiple files reference team functionality but the actual Team model is missing

3. Frontend Team References:
Vue Components: Multiple Vue components reference teams:
resources/js/Components/Desktop/TeamBanner.vue
resources/js/Components/Desktop/TeamManagementModal.vue
resources/js/Components/Desktop/Taskbar.vue (team switcher)
API Service: resources/js/Tenant/ApiService.ts has team-related methods:
getUserTeams()
switchTeam()
getTeamMembers()
TypeScript Types: env.d.ts includes allTeams?: Record<string, unknown>[]

4. Backend Team References:
Middleware: Multiple middleware files reference team functionality:
app/Http/Middleware/WalletTenantMiddleware.php
app/Http/Middleware/AiChatTenantMiddleware.php
Controllers: Various controllers reference team functionality
Services: app/Services/CommandExecutionService.php references teams

5. Documentation References:
Markdown Files: Multiple documentation files still reference Jetstream and teams functionality
Migration Complete: MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md mentions "Jetstream with Teams"
Refactoring Summary: REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md mentions "Jetstream Teams"
🔧 REQUIRED FIXES TO COMPLETE LARAVEL 12 MIGRATION:
Remove Jetstream Dependencies: The User model needs to be updated to remove Jetstream traits
Implement Team Functionality: Either implement custom team functionality or remove all team references

Fix Missing Imports: Add proper import statements or remove unused trait references
Update Frontend: Remove or update team-related Vue components and TypeScript code
Update Documentation: Remove all Jetstream and team references from documentation
📋 SUMMARY:
Status: This is a Laravel 12 application with Laravel Vue Starter Kit, but it still contains significant Jetstream and teams functionality that needs to be either properly implemented or completely removed. The application is in a transitional state where the framework has been upgraded but the authentication/team system hasn't been fully migrated from Jetstream to the Vue Starter Kit.
