# Desktop Application Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The monolithic `app.js` file (30,368 lines) has been successfully refactored into a modern, modular TypeScript architecture that integrates seamlessly with Laravel + Stancl/Tenancy v4 + Jetstream Teams.

Jetstream needs to be replaced with [Laravel Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit/)

## Architecture Overview

### Before (Monolithic)
- Single 30,368-line JavaScript file
- Global variables and functions
- Tight coupling between components
- No module system
- Difficult to maintain and scale

### After (Modular)
- Organized TypeScript modules with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture with proper abstractions
- Lazy loading and code splitting for performance
- Tenant-aware API integration
- Scalable and maintainable structure

## New File Structure

```

### 3. Creating New Apps
```typescript
// 1. Create new app class extending BaseApp
import { BaseApp } from './BaseApp';

export class MyNewApp extends BaseApp {
  protected async render(): Promise<void> {
    // Implement app UI
  }
  
  protected getWindowOptions() {
    return { width: 800, height: 600 };
  }
}

// 2. Register the app

// (Update AppLoader.ts importAppModule method)
```

### 4. Team Switching
```typescript
// Switch to different team
await desktopApp.switchTeam('new-team-id');

// All apps will receive team switch events automatically
```
